## 🔮 ABOUT THE PROJECT

Welcome to my digital playground. This portfolio is not just a showcase of work; it's a demonstration of **modern web capabilities**. Built with a focus on performance and visual fidelity, it bridges the gap between static web design and interactive 3D environments.

### 🌟 CORE FEATURES

*   **🌌 Immersive 3D Hero**: A reactive, distorted sphere shading system that responds to your mouse movement, built with custom GLSL shaders.
*   **🎥 Cinematic Scrolling**: Seamless camera transitions guide you through the "story" of the portfolio, powered by `ScrollControls`.
*   **💠 Cyber Hedron**: An interactive, rotating wireframe Icosahedron that brings the "About Me" section to life.
*   **🃏 3D Project Gallery**: A floating, parallax-scrolling gallery of project cards that gain depth and focus on hover.
*   **⚡ Performance First**:
    *   Dynamic sizing and asset loading.
    *   Optimized particle rendering (`<Particles />`).
    *   Responsive 3D layouts for mobile & desktop.

## 📂 ARCHITECTURE

The codebase is structured to separate the **DOM** (UI) from the **Canvas** (3D) while keeping them synchronized.

```bash
src/
├── app/                  # Next.js App Router (Pages)
├── components/
│   ├── canvas/           # 🪐 The 3D World (Scene, Blob, Gallery)
│   └── dom/              # 📄 The UI Overlay (Hero Text, Buttons)
├── styles/               # Global CSS & Tailwind config
└── constants/            # Data-driven content
```
